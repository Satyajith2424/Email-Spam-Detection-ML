## 📌 Task 4: Machine Learning Model Implementation

This project was developed as part of the Python Internship at **CodTech IT Solutions**.

---

### ✅ Objective

To create a predictive machine learning model using **Scikit-learn** to classify emails as **spam** or **not spam** using natural language processing (NLP) and text vectorization techniques.

---

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- TF-IDF Vectorization  
- Logistic Regression  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

### 🔍 Description

This notebook demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing of email text data
- Cleaning and handling missing values
- Text vectorization using `TfidfVectorizer`
- Building a Logistic Regression model to classify emails
- Model evaluation using accuracy score
- Prediction on custom user input email text

---

### 📁 Files Included

- `Email Spam Detection.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook file
- `mail_data.csv` – Dataset containing email messages and their labels (`1 = ham(not spam)`, `0 = spam`)
- `requirements.txt` – Required Python packages
- `README.md` – Documentation file

### ▶️ How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML-Model-Spam-Detection.git
   cd ML-Model-Spam-Detection
   
2.Install Required Libraries
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
3.Run the Notebook
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook "Email Spam Detection.ipynb"
  ```
✅ Outcome
